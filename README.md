# Type Error in Python Function
This example demonstrates a common type error in Python that occurs when attempting to perform an arithmetic operation (addition) between an integer and a string. The function `function` takes two arguments and attempts to add them together, but if one argument is an integer and the other is a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Save the provided code as `bug.py`
2. Run the script using a python interpreter.
